The Motionmask web application offers selective or total video anonymization using AI objected detection and tracking based on Deep Vision proprietary models and then blurring the selected targets. The Motionmask website offers the following functionalities: Video Upload, Choosing the blurring mode (Full/Selective blurring of people and/or cars), Identification and selection of identified actors in the video, request processing, Video preview and Download. The processing is done in a novel way using decentralized edge processing nodes based on AiXpand technology - each job is divided into multiple shards that are distributed in a decentralized peer-to-peer trustless and secure way among active processing nodes using AiXpand proprietary technology. This processing approach drastically reduces video processing time (detection, bluring, etc) while keeping a very low cost and carbon footprint.",
